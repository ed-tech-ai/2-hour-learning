- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: The article explores the adaptation of traditional item response theory (IRT) for use in computerised adaptive testing (CAT). It discusses how new item selection rules in CAT can enhance the precision and efficiency of student assessments. Adapting questions during CAT will also ensure that the boundary of a student's mastery is correctly identified and the student is kept suitably challenged and stimulated during the CAT itself.

- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This book provides an introduction to the principles and methods of computerised adaptive testing (CAT). It explains how adaptive testing adjusts the difficulty of test items in real-time, based on the test-takerâ€™s performance, leading to more accurate assessments. It is interesting that even though the principles behind CAT remains largely unchanged, the experience of taking a CAT will vary greatly depending on what the purpose of the CAT is (e.g. testing for mastery of a technical topic vs testing for mastery of critical thinking skills).
## AI-Enhanced Insights
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 1
Adaptive testing aligns with the goal of precision learning by dynamically adjusting the difficulty of tests to match the student's ability. This prevents the students from being demotivated (when the test is too difficult) or bored (when the test is too easy), thus optimising their learning efficiency.
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 2
By integrating adaptive testing into the curriculum, the educational approach shifts from a one-size-fits-all model to a personalised experience. It is not just the tests that evolve with the learner's progress, but also the recommendations (which come after taking the tests) that evolve with the learner.
