- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This article outlines how diagnostic assessments can be integrated into mastery-based learning frameworks, ensuring students achieve mastery before progressing to more advanced content. It discusses the role of continuous assessment in supporting mastery. Like it or not, assessments are very effective in detecting level of mastery, and this is absolute crucial to ensure that students only move on to more advanced materials when they have the basics right. If they move on to more advanced materials without getting the foundation right, there will be gaps in knowledge that become almost impossible to bridge as they advance further and further.

- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This book explores the concept of mastery-based learning, where students must achieve a high level of understanding in one topic before moving to the next. The approach focuses on individualised learning pace and frequent assessments to ensure mastery. Not all students will learn at the same pace and hence, they will master a topic/skill at different times or with different amount of practice. This is where having a personalised learning path becomes very helpful in ensuring all students get all the practice they need and can eventually master the topic/skill.
## AI-Enhanced Insights
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 1
The assessment-centric approach helps to drive mastery by using tests not just as checkpoints, but also as integral tools to ensure students achieve a deep level of understanding before advancing.
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 2
Mastery-based progression, supported by frequent and targeted assessments, transforms the learning journey into a series of achievable milestones, ensuring rapid and sustainable educational growth. Often, gamification of mastery-based progression is effective and practical at maintaining high level of motivation among students.
