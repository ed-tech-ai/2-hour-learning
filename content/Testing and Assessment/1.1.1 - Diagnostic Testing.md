- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This article discusses a framework for integrating diagnostic assessments into the curriculum. It covers key components such as the design of diagnostic tests, feedback mechanisms, and remedial instruction, all aimed at identifying and addressing student learning gaps. Diagnostic assessments, when not used as intended, can add significant stress to students and be counter-productive. It is therefore crucial that they are well-thought-out and well-executed, with the reason for them being clearly communicated.

- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This article explores the role of tests in enhancing learning by identifying gaps and focusing study efforts. It emphasises how diagnostic testing can not just serve as an assessment tool, but also as a way to promote long-term retention and deeper understanding. Humans (which of course includes students) learn well when information is presented to them more than once and spaced out over time. Preparing for tests allows for exactly that: Students have to go over information that was taught to them a while back when revising, and will likely do this several times (e.g. during revision lessons with their teachers, with their study groups, on their own).
## AI-Enhanced Insights
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 1
Diagnostic testing serves as the starting point for personalised learning, allowing educators to identify the starting point and specific gaps for each student. This then allows for a tailored learning journey for each student, right from the outset.
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 2
The "testing first" philosophy positions diagnostic tests as critical tools to align learning content with individual student needs, ensuring that every piece of content is purposeful and targeted. Students who are constantly challenged at the right level tend to have higher level of motivation and better knowledge retention.
