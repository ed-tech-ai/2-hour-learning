## Categories and Subtopic Identified by AI

#### Category 1.1 - Testing as a Tool for Personalised Learning
Testing is not just used for evaluation, but also as a foundational element to identify individual learning needs and guide targeted, efficient instruction.
##### Subtopic [[1.1.1 - Diagnostic Testing]]
This involves using initial tests to identify each student's strengths, weaknesses, and knowledge gaps. These diagnostics allow educators to tailor instruction and resources to the specific needs of the student, ensuring a more effective learning process.
##### Subtopic [[1.1.2 - Adaptive Testing]]
Adaptive tests adjust their difficulty based on the learner's responses in real-time. This approach ensures that students are neither bored by overly simple questions nor overwhelmed by too difficult ones, making the learning experience more personalised and engaging.
#### Category 1.2 - Assessment-Centric Approach to Mastery Learning
Assessments are not always bad! Aligning different types of assessments with educational goals helps to ensure mastery of learning outcomes and progress.
##### Subtopic [[1.2.1 - Formative Assessment]]
Formative assessments are low-stakes tests administered throughout the learning process. They help in tracking student progress and understanding, allowing educators to adjust instruction as needed to ensure that students achieve mastery before moving on to more complex topics.
##### Subtopic [[1.2.2 - Mastery-Based Progression]]
Assessments can be used as a means to confirm mastery before students advance to the next level. It ensures that students have fully grasped a concept or skill before moving forward, thereby preventing gaps in learning and promoting a deeper understanding.

Note: First, I provided the spiky POV and its description as input into the AI tool, and asked the AI tool to use them as the context for all the subsequent responses. Next, I asked the AI to identify the main categories of this spiky POV and their subtopics, and give a brief description for all of them. I then selected the main categories and subtopics that made sense to me. Finally, I edited the text to be more accurate.
