- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This article highlights the importance of formative assessments as tools for learning enhancement. It discusses how frequent testing helps students identify their strengths and weaknesses, leading to more targeted and effective learning strategies. Formative assessment should be intentional but does not have to happen explicitly. For example, teachers can use fun indicators like "traffic lights" or "go/stop" to assess if they should continue on to new materials or review previous materials. *(You can ask me more about these if you are curious)*

- Original synthesis of AI-generated summary: This book emphasises the role of formative assessments in transforming education. Popham argues that formative assessments, when used effectively, can significantly enhance student learning by providing continuous feedback that informs instruction. Students can sometimes lack the ability to reflect, and hence do not consciously think about what exactly needs to be worked on (e.g. having poor mastery of English could be the reason why the student is not excelling in Science, which is being taught in English). By providing feedback along the way can help students reflect more deeply what is hindering their success.
## AI-Enhanced Insights
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 1
Formative assessments are crucial, as they provide continuous feedback that informs and allows for adjustment of the teaching process, which ensures that learning is constantly aligned with student needs.
#### AI-Enhanced Insight 2
The integration of formative assessments ensures that learning is a dynamic process, where progress is continuously measured and instruction is adapted to ensure mastery before moving forward. The integration of formative assessments is very much an art, there are many dimensions to consider - how to integrate; when to integrate; what to include in the formative assessment; how will the students respond to the formative assessment.
