## Use of AI in this Process

The AI tool used here was ChatGPT-4o. It gives results that adhere closely to what the prompts had requested for and is able to present results in a much neater format.

Each time I obtain an output from the AI tool (e.g. in between the different steps), I will read through the output to ensure that it made sense and edit it as necessary before I proceeded with the next step. If the input information is not 100% accurate, it will impact the quality of the subsequent output.

Another point to note, at the start on exploring each spiky POV, I provided the spiky POV and its description as input into the AI tool, and asked the AI tool to use them as the context for all the subsequent responses. 
## Impact of AI Use on Productivity and Quality of Second Brain 

The use of AI has overall enhanced my productivity, it was able to scan through a large volume of information, sift out the relevant pieces and provide summaries and some basic insights. Without it, I would have had to spend much time to locate, read and digest many sources of information.

ChatGPT-4o was able to provide mostly relevant information and could have been an adequate second brain. However, to create a truly remarkable second brain, human intervention is still needed at this point. Firstly, ChatGPT-4o is great at summarising text but it is not the best at picking out what is the crux of the matter. Secondly, there is still a need for the human to perform good prompt engineering to ensure that the output adheres to the prompt requirements as much as possible. It is useful to have background knowledge about prompt engineering (e.g. deciding to write a subject-based, problem-based or learner-based prompt; or using a zero/one/few-shot prompt). 

I had performed steps 1-5 sequentially (i.e. evaluated the output of step 1 before using it as input for step 2). Out of curiosity, I entered all 5 steps in one prompt and evaluated the output. It actually fulfilled what was requested for, which is a testament to the AI's ability to understand instructions and synthesise a response. However, the response had less focus and lacked the insights that come through experience.
## Second Brain in Obsidian

Even though this set of notes does not touch on all of Obsidian's functionalities, Obsidian is a suitable tool for arranging a second brain. Especially for managing knowledge over the longer term, a graph-based knowledge management system is helpful for connecting different topics. As this knowledge management system is unique to every person, it might not be the most suitable for presenting unstructured knowledge to others.
