Note: First, I provided the spiky POV and its description as input into the AI tool, and asked the AI tool to use them as the context for all the subsequent responses. Next, I asked the AI to identify the main categories of this spiky POV and their subtopics, and give a brief description for all of them. I then selected the main categories and subtopics that made sense to me. Finally, I edited the text to be more accurate.
